/**********    1_Arithmatic Operators 
 * All arithmatic operator are called binery operators.That means for their operation required two operands.
 * These are all occure on RHS of assignment operators because these are all expressions.By the operations of these operator
 * the operands are not effect it will only deals with their values and assign to a third variable. 
 * Arithmatic operators are used for arithmatic operations for example addition, subtraction, division and multiplication.One is
 * specific operator that called modulus operator. It hold reminder after dividing the number.
 * These are arithmatic operator that used in c.
 * 1_Addition(+): To add two operands.
 * 2_Subtraction(-): To Subtract two operands. 
 * 3_Multiplication(*): To Multiply two operands.
 * 4_Division(/): To divide two operands.
 * Integer division always truncate.That means fraction part will be truncate and only whole number will returned(result) for example
 * 5/2 that answer will be 2.
 * 5_Modulus(%): This operator first divide two operands and save return their remainder.for example 5 % 2 will give 1.  **********/
 
/******************************            Precedence of Operators
 * Precedence of operators means to which operator evaluate first.and second is order of evaluation(Association) that is always left to right.
 * The below is precedence of Arithmatic operators 
 * Highest: ().
 * Next: *, /, %.
 * Lowest: +, -.                ******************************/
